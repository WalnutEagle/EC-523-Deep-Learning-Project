# EC523-Deep-Learning-Project
## 2D TO 3D RECONSTRUCTION OF MEDICAL IMAGES USING UNSUPERVISED GANs
### Project Description
The goal of this project was to make use of unsupervised/weakly supervised learning to reconstruct 3D images from biplanar 2D chest XRay inputs. Various architectures were experimented with and tested. 
Please refer to our report for more information on the project. Each of the folders correspond to the different architectures and experiments that were carried out.
