This folder contains the data we used for our project. The dataset is mainly used from the paper X2CT-GAN: Reconstructing CT from Biplanar X-Rays with Generative Adversarial Networks.

Since the dataset is too big it is manually uploaded on SCC under the projects folder under team number 11.
Rest of the code is the same.
